# ScreenManager

If you plan to do anything Gauntlet-related \(e.g. UIs\), you should familiarize yourself with the Screen Manager.

The Screen Manager can be used to push screens \(which may load [Movies](movie.md)\), check which screen is focused or top-most, or pop a screen when you are done with it.
