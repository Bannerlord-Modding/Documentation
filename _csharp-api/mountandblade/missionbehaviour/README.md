# MissionBehaviour

Mission Behaviours are used to control the [Mission](../mission.md). This can be anything from spawning [Agents](../agent.md) to adding boundaries for the Mission. A mission can have any amount of mission behaviours.

[MissionLogic](missionlogic.md) and [MissionViews](missionview.md) are both types of MissionBehaviours \(they inherit MissionBehaviour\).

## Properties
- `BehaviourType` - Type of the mission behaviour. Currently can be Logic or Other. MissionLogic instances have Logic as set. For other mission behaviours, use of Other is recommended.
- `DebugInput` - IInputContext instance for debugging. Note that released builds may not have a working instance.
- `Mission` - [Mission](../mission.md) of this mission behaviour. If you add same mission behaviour instance to multiple missions, this property will hold the last one. Note that using same mission behaviour instance with multiple missions is not recommended unless you know what you are doing.

## Mission Callbacks
- `OnAfterMissionCreated()` - Called right after the mission is created on C# side. Call of this callback will be the first method call of the mission beaviour. However, mission behaviours added after the mission is created won't have this callback called.
- `OnBehaviourInitialize()` - Called right after the mission is fully created. This is the recommended callback for initialization. If a mission behaviour (including official ones) is added after the mission creation, this callback should be called manually.
- `OnCreated()` - Called whenever a mission behaviour is added to a mission.
- `EarlyStart()` - Called at the mission start, right before `AfterStart` callback.
- `AfterStart()` - Called at the mission start.
- `OnRenderingStarted()` - Called when rendering of the scene is started.
- `OnPreMissionTick(float)` - Called at the start of tick on the engine side.
  - `float` - Time passed since last tick.
- `OnPreDisplayMissionTick(float)` - Called at the start of tick mission tick. Note that this is called before agents and teams are ticked and also before `OnMissionTick`.

- `OnClearScene()` - Called when the scene is being cleared. Note that this is called after after `OnRemove` and `OnDelete` called for all agents in the scene. This is the recommend callback for resetting mission behaviour when mission is reset.
- `HandleOnCloseMission()` - Called when a mission is about to end. It is not recommend to override and use this callback. Prefer other callbacks like `OnEndMission` for end of the mission tasks.
- `OnEndMission()` - Called when mission is ending. This is the recommend callback for end of the mission tasks. It is also recommended to unregister events in this callback if any registered.
