# Making Banners
You can make banners using the [Banner Editor](https://bannerlord.party/banner/), made by reddit user [BizzFarts](https://www.reddit.com/user/bizzfarts/).
The given code can be used as an entry for the common tag *'banner_key'*, an example of this is seen in the SandBox\spclan.xml. Also, you can post and discuss banner designs on [r/BannerlordBanners](https://www.reddit.com/r/BannerlordBanners/).

After you have finished your banner design, you can copy the code and paste it into the Game's Banner editor. This is useful for seeing what your design will look like in-game.
