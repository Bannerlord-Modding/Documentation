# MissionBehaviour

Mission Behaviours are used to control the [Mission](mission.md). This can be anything from spawning [Agents](agent.md) to adding boundaries for the Mission.

[MissionLogic](missionlogic.md) and [MissionViews](missionview.md) are both types of MissionBehaviours \(they inherit MissionBehaviour\).
